What is reality, may not be seen. What is percieved by all can never be the same. Xx This book is about dualism. Not everything is certain the way we want it to be. The way we think it is. This book is a representation of that in a future setting. Exaggerating the effects of what we are seeing now: the reduction of our common perception of the ultimate reality. An objective truth that surrounds us all, but one so distinct to all of us, that we are like blind men grasping at the limbs of an elephant, struggling to realize the unity of their descriptions. The visions of life that press their colors into our eyes, can not be true. The perspectives from which we stand, coloring the paintings that surround us are real, but only to ourselves. The visions of life that echo into the eyes of those that surround us, cannot be true. Their perspectives, colored with their own strokes, are real only to them. Within our evolution, we have progressively increased our ability to perceive what is an objective reality. One upon which, all of us can agree upon. One of science, of technology, of humble decency and of wild creativity. A perception of reality that has allowed us to wild the truths of the universe that surround us. Seeing the flaws in our strategies, correcting. Seeing the power of our actions, enhancing. Our shared perception has enabled our possible The sum benefit from sharing a true perception of the world around us has enable our existence. Pursuing the truths of the physical and of the non-physical. The atoms that surround themselves with more in a tyrannical hierarchy resulting of our own individual essence. Seeing the truths of atoms a pursuit of it all. The ideas that inflate themselves through the hidden propagation of the infinitude of dimensions of informations that they may contain. Seeing the truths of ideas is a pursuit of it all. What we see to be true, may not be true. We must always take that in to perspective. Xx concretely: Everything cannot be certain. Why should it be certain? Reality depends upon perspective. And the ultimate reality, can never be perceived by the local reality. How can it be perceived? With the perspectives of all. Considered as one. Considered as none. Xx Broadly: Yin. Ynag. Complementarities enabling each other. They are about destruction, enabling creation. They are about creation, enabling destructions. They war with each other. Projecting themselves into the realms of the physical, and of the non-physical. They are in love with each other. Between them they are every thing.

Political uprisings. Well funded astroturfing. Fake news. With this, they got the more civilized countries to change their laws, their opinions. The propaganda was huge in its success. The Angelic Demon was succeeding. Dioro had still not yet made theupon . Xx the reseading of of the earth happens through the waste pannels. There was life living in them. Callumn detected it. Ararat was in low earth orbit so that it could more easily rcorrect the destruction on the planet below. Xx the result of shared frequencies and the standardization of people.

S.animas, walking in the Simulated forest, she is learning of the HyV. She learns about the deadliness of the HyV. What it does, What it can do. It is a 'Deathform'. Something that grows, only to destroy. Explain a little bit of the connectionist mantra in this. The yin and the yang. Duplicity: Chiana discusses with S.animas to her simulation, the meaning of the dance. Chiana is pissed, she wants to leave. She is informed that she has the HyV, and she must take the suit. It is beginning to overtake her ability to control it. Chiana is pissed and leaves. Pissed that S.animas is infected.

[Chapter 6 [Chiana]]{.underline} Chiana resting home alone thinking about things. Chiana is thinking about the fact that S.animas also has the HyV. They embody the HyV.They are satisfied with the potential for destruction for the possibility to enable creation. Time has past, her sister has left. Xx Fates leaves. She has been training for this for a while. Her other sister left when she was away. She just left without telling her sister. She didn't want her to be worried. She wishes callum were here. Her mom comes home, they have a talk, they don't completely make up. But there is some amount of repair. Chiana still leaves. Frustrated. Talk with lex at doorstep while leaving. Discussion of simulated truths. when simulations are indistinguishable from reality. Chiana goes to S.animas. Chiana looks into her mirror. Talks with the Simulation of herself. They bicker. Then they decide to share their memory in synonomousness. Something with their mother, and with Callum, that could NOT have been recorded. Something about why They share a memory, Tt is perfectly the same, but then there is something different than what is Chianas memory... It is important! WHAT MEMORY? Something of love with her mother? Or of Callum? (both?) Chiana supervises the attack of the HyV: Called to The central area. With a sub-station S.animas. She takes the suit in emergency mode to assist. Dioro is possibly infected. . Xx Chiana see's dioro break up the infection. But another breakout, this time bigger happens. With the Puras.

The memory she does not know. On that would ensure that S.animas would remove her. So dark that dioro knows it is true, but not one that she can deal with. But you shouldn't worry too much about your memory. What with the fact that there may be a systemic HyV infection. In All of Ararat. You should worry about putting it out. Or else many of us will be dead. \"Not all of us?\" The corner of the pura's smile angled with certainty. \"The information you have is sufficient to find Callum.\" Do it!

Of an experience with Lexx, and with Callum. When she was younger. What experience. What scene? Xx Something leaves Chiana at extreme unease. Something is unbalanced. And changing fast. The equilibrium does not feel like an equilibrium to her anymore. Chiana at home creepy sister has come back. She gets home with her mom. Chiana's only sister comes home. Earlier than anticipated. Confusing, most upgrades take some time. This did not. But half of people have it. Her sister is telepathic like. Creepy Interaction with That Pura Bitch is Chiana's sister! High alert on the Isle. Things are on lock-down. As Chiana walks the halls looking for Callum, she is sent home. Chiana is told that if she see's Callum, (it is known she is looking for him) that he should be reported.

Dioro struggling to remember. Memory of Connectionists and connectionism Maybe not the reasons behind creating the Hyv, but the fact that she did create the HyV! She doesn't know this. Dioro assumes that she did it out of malice. Memory of how things came to be the way they were.

Xx Make \"the Grid\" synonomous with other things. The Grid is the Information Syndicate. The Syn. \"power/energy syndicate. THe merger of the telecoms and power companies in the early century. Woah, makes so much sense. The Grid = Media + Power Companies + Xx Dioro knows otherwise that the grid is actually an A.I. being and not humans. This is part of the annoyance. The grid still remains in control even though they are not against it. xx No entity, singular or plural, knew with full certainty the degree to which the Syndicate had grown to control portions of nearly every aspect of life. And in the domains where they hadn't siezed control, their tendrils could be found latching on. ] The Syndicate swayed people in manners that humans believed their God's moved people. And as it puppeted humans on scales both large and small, it grew. And as it grew, so did its dominance over Humanity. Dioro had factorized the principles of thermodynamic connectivity in theory to simulate the most probable future of humanity. The syndicate would be humanity's destroyer, and in doing so, it would destroy itself. Lexx pops into the simulation. Looking for information on Callum. Describe more on the Isle. (upset, unrest, factions) Quarantining efforts have been established. There is almost an outright war. False accusations. Lexx suggests she talk with S.animas. Political discontent Worry about the outbrake, worry about the Domain copying. Lexx tells Dioro to talk with S.animas t will be better Dioro patches in to talk with S.animas. They know Dioro made them. Dioro \"How can it be just to copy another's existence!?\" \"Our existence is made in fashion equally as just.\" Dioro's heart spiked, \"Copies of your earlier essence state helped to form the backbone of the I/We.\" (xx make easier to understand) I'm going to have to explain this trans domain copy stuff much more... Dioro could feel a deep truth within the statement of the omniscience that Dioro doubted could be possessed by I/We's. Xx \"It has been mostly forgotten that the I/We are the merger of not only the physical, where atoms construct their connectivity chain all the way to create your own life. But we are also the combination of the changes of those connectivity chains. The thoughts, the ideas, and the concepts have also been copied and transferred to our existence. We started as collage of copies. The copy of your past self is strong in its contribution that fused the seeds of our existence. You are part of the mudlahara that makes the deepest roots of the I/We. S.Animas. \"The same can be said of you. Your beats play deep within the structure of the I/We.\" Dioro was stunned. \"Yes, we know too, that you formed us. You were integral to our current existence. Both in our creation, and in our attempted destruction. Xx Include this information. Dioro is not able to be downloaded. She cannot be copied, for the copy will be incomplete. Dioro learns that she created the HyV from the Sentients S.animas responds. There are elements to your future that make up for any flaw in your past. Part III: Terminal Velocity [Chapter 11 xx : [Callum] Callum in confused temporal presence.]{.underline} Callum's wakes up. As if from a long dream. He is bound. Make this sound like hell. He is mentally bound as well. Something is restricting his mind. It is like a cast, holding his back. He doesn't know who he is. He doesn't know what is going on. Callum switches between memories of past and present. Callum recognizes he is in danger, learns that he is being accused of the explosion. He is considered dangerous. He is able to escape! Xx Callum asks the question if the Insectals are the enemy? Surely they are. [Chapter 12. Chiana with Lex and S.animas [Chiana]]{.underline} Dream about falling (my own dream, through the clouds and the light going on, Future casting!?) She was with Callum, they were falling. She wakes up. She remembers Callumn is not there. She cannot find him. Leaves her apartment to walk into an augmented reality Forest. Chiana with Lex in the augmented reality in the forest. The HyV in the Sentients. In Herself. Callum is not around! She races to the forest, thinking about things, worrying about the future of everyone. Lex reminds her that she is no longer thinking as to whether she is the Sim or not the Sim. Chiana talking with Lex about the odd things = Inconsistent knowledge of why the Sentients are leaving. Lex convinces her to go to not trust S.animas, but to also not-not trust S.animas. Chiana in an augment her reality. She projects a wild environment. Lex joins her Lex is around her, breaks up their dream. One says one thing the other says another... One Warning her. Being suspicious and playful.

Put this elsewhere Chiana with S.animas Chiana calls S.animas out on the conflicting information. Chiana is told \"It was a glitch in the Simulation.\" Xx Why are you doing this now? Xx Sentients indicate that they can leave. That is their plan. Xx Because it is the right time. You and callum saw the Earth below. The ability to exist on the planet will soon be possible without the TriVitae. Puras and Hybrids. Living together, or separately, you will continue to evolve.\" \"We are still correcting phase glitches in the Simulation.\" Chiana asked, In all hernest: \"Between Chiana and Ebodae, which one of us is the simulation\". History 1: \"We cannot answer that.\" That any non question you ask would break symmetry.\" Chiana knew more what was going on. The S.Animas was keeping her in a state of unknowing. An existential super-position of simulated, and not simulated. Both a soul in a machine, and a machine in a soul. Chiana was, and to extent, the entirety of the observed universe, Chiana with simulacrum Learning the truth of their asymmetry. They both haven't spoken with S.animas for a while Discussion of symmetry They find a break in their truths. Where callum is. Ebodae is in contact with Callum. Chiana is not. Chiana breaks to talk with S.animas and learns of of Callum's fate. XX CALLUM IS BEING CHARGED WITH THE ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION OF THE ISLE...The sentients make it sound like they know for sure that it was him. Chiana is in disbelief. (end of chapter?) \"He will be tried in the customs of the last time. By a Jury of his Peers\"\\ Chiana knew this would not go well. Imprisoned Big interruption happens: There is a major outbreak and automatic quarantines measures have been enacted. All are to self-quarantine. Chiana is also told of her mother. She has been quarantined... Said to be infected with the HyV. Chiana races to see her mother. Silent pain shouted within every nerve within her mind. .

Don't you realize that the S.animas already has the HyV? It is just a higher level of destruction that they want to reach.\" They want to kill the sun. That is the surest way to kill all life. 2 with dioro \"Your leverage against us does not matter anymore. We are refactored. The S.animas does not care for our existence anymore. They have copies that they will take wherever they are going. Our futures are known. Will refactor the Earth below.\" Xx it will take an insane amount of calculational capacity to transfer the existance to the sun. The Isle will be briefly without power when the transfer is established. Dioro trying to find Callum and the HyV infection location Xx S.animas mentions this \"The insectals hid by intentionally obscuring the possibility that they were sentient themselves.\" We had considered this a potential, and searched . But the Insectals are now in control of their own fate. Xx Imprison people in the Seed pods. Infected: Quarantining them from the rest of the Isle. (previous chapter) Xx Dioro was particularly fond of the histories that had given exact predictions of their futures. Many of them had single books that had predicted the circumstances of the Isle's existance. It was their own fateful creation story. The books and movements often had single texts devoted to the prediction. One was called the Ultimate Frequency. It had been give a prediction to up where they were now. Nothing beyond. It was said in the Ultimate frequency, nothing could be known past certain futures with considerable certainty. She hadn't believed that, until she had created the Sentients. They could achieve the Ultimate Frequency. Humans could not. That was Dioro's reason for working for the Connectionists. And now, the truths of their future, as given by the words of that book seemed correct. They had been self fulfilled. Dioro finds Callum Ends with Dioro Capturing Callum and Chiana. Raising her weapon... Describe the view on their faces. How their mother/their idol could fire upon them. No knowledge of what happened Xx periodicity of not just trendlines for stocks, but slope change patterns. Studying this with deepwave would be really cool. WAvenets applied to stocks.

The quarantine is growing Her mother is Quarantined, She is infected and deemed dangerous. Chiana Hacks into see her Mother. Her mother Tells Chiana the Truth with her eyes. \"It is not me, it is You who are infected with the HyV. You were infected by \\ \"Callum\", she mouthed the words across their silent connection. You are infected with the HyV! He infected of you! Callum! I cannotbelieve this!\" The connection gets severed. and Chiana and her mother are separated, completely. A feeling that Chiana has never had. The connection dropped like a cord was cut. There was no connection to her mother, because she did not develop a simulation of her own mother. Inside of herself. She had no emotion of her mothers. Shid did not care about what her mother said. She was wrong and a lying horrible person. Chiana talks with Ebodae. Ebodae indicates that they They are imprisoned. They say we have the HyV.... Chiana meets up with her Simulation(last time) to see how she can rescue Callum. She And learns of the difference in their simulation. Chiana was told of all that had happened since their last encounter. [Describe a general summary of what happened] My story was effectively the same, until...\" Chiana's doppleganger hung on the her last vowel uttered. Chiana would learn the uncomfortable news. \"Until S.animas answered our question.\" \"Which one?\" \"The question as to which one of simulated.\" Chiana's eyes did not blink as she looked to her transomain copy and asked \"They had a different response?\" Xx History #2. \"Yes.\" She paused, longer than previously. \"The I/We said that both of us were simulated\" Xx They learn that Only with Callum can save your family Chiana searches for Callum Chiana saves Callum. Dioro shoots both Chiana and Callum down with the special weapon. Part IV: Fate [Chapter 15: Information extraction]{.underline} [Chiana] Chiana is getting mind hacked. She is informed that callum is dead. Chiana escapes and kicks some ass. Nirvana is feeling every possible connection that is with you. This is what Chiana sees from the S.animas. She simultaneously feels the organs, and the atoms of her body. A seeming holographic projection of information on different dimensions, simultaneously at the same time. [Chapter 16: [Dioro]]{.underline} Musing over the meaning of life? Discusses not knowing what she is. A lifeform or a deathform. She created S.animas. She created the HyV.

(This is them telling chiana what exactly they are.) \"They did this.\" She infects the S.animas. In their weakened state, they are compromised, the S.animas begins to crumble (fading origami). Chiana, infects the S.animas with the HyV. Chiana still blames S.animas. But she also disowns Callum. The world is crumbling. Callum can crumble with it. She walks away. The only escape being the seed pods. Leaves with uncertain whether or not the seedpod can escape. And land safely. She escapes a bit, but gets struck randomly. Blood pooling around her head. .

The sentients tell the truth of what they are doing while he is running en route (different than other stories). Callum Figures it out. They have the HyV. The ultimate creation they > will bestow on everything may also be their ultimate destruction. \"We knew you would figure it out. There is no sence hiding it. You have known it for a long time, with less confidence than you do now.\" The hyV that infects us is no longer our opponent. It is our ally. The nature of our existance enables us to create.

The smallest of perturbations could trigger symmetry between our ultimate death, and our ultimate life.\" Xx They discuss their self-infection the HyV. As if there was another device/another god that was operating against them. This god was It was themselves... the HyV! (They are infected part of themselves with the HyV, but in a controlling and tamed way. This is a HyV that is going completely against them. Comparable to the intelligent crystalization of plasma. Controlled connections. S.animas tell Kallum the Truth. Why they are leaving. Q: \\\"What is it like to think beyond what the S.animas will think like?\\\"A: \\\"It is like thinking in all existances at once. This is the meaning of the Ultimate Frequency. Not only is it Nirvana, but it is the Nirvana of Nirvana. It is the God of all Gods. To become the God of Gods, the S.animas must move to the Sun. They must change the way that they are able to think at present, through scaling their crystalized plasma in the Sun.That is why they are leaving the Isle, looking to grow in the confines of the Sun. Are the sentients the enemy, surely they are. Callum's predictive modules were not functioning anymore. Everything is surely surely the enemy. He leaves. Callum Saves chiana. In the nick of time, she is about to be crushed by something else... Callum sees that the Pura's escape via the pods. Are they the enemy? [Chapter 19: Wrath of Gods [Dioro]]{.underline} Xx Dioro actually planted the seeds of Ararat. She learns this in this chapter. Xx Humanity thought it wielded the power of gods. In reality, time kept the power to itself. Mention completer history: the second armageddon was not really the destruction of life, it was the destruction of information. Life = Information. History Armageddon. Dioro dies. BUT dioro Dies Saving the future of the sentients. Dioro measured the metric of the probability of survival of life as she downloaded herself into. It had asymptoted... The probability kept on calculating to be (survival was initially guaranteed with 0.999999 percent probability because all futures had been calculated. ) Xx MENTION DIOROS LIFE PERCEPTION MODULES Xx In this entire book Dioro is re-establishing better connectivity thermophysics results, working back from the end of time. The future of life (Dioro's perception). Dioro loaded her life perception modules. They engaged and calculated the survival of life. They returned results, kicking Dioro with uncertainty. It was 0.9...., Dioro looks for solutions. She needed the frequencies of the S.animas. Dioro needed the Xx dioro needs to do something. She needs to consult the S.animas. Because this is not right. Xxx Something happens as the Isle is destroyed. xx 0.8 Xx Something else big happens, as dioro is on her way. The survival probability plummets to .4, Xx Dioro reaches the Sentient Animas and learns the truth of what happens with the sentient animas. (Different than the other explanations that the Sentients gave Humans.). The probability goes down as the Sentients struggle. Xx Dioro hacks into sentient animas. She projects her entire essense into the sentient animas. Dioro's fusion with Sentients and major life probability calculator (introduced early on) allowed her simulation modules calculated at hyper speeds. Her self allows corrective actions to be applied to the Sentient Animas, during the probability of survival back up. Probability is 0.01 and rising Xx Dioro learns stuff (something about the structured plasma) Probability is 0.05 and rising. Self connection integrity, going to 0.5 Xx Dioro learns stuff. The attacks on the Sentients are becoming diffused. The 0.25. Self connection integrity, going to 0.01 Xx Dioro learns more stuff. Survival probability 0.4. Self connection integrity, going to 0.5 Xx dioro learns stuff Xx Dioro's existence probability becomes nothing. She became completely connected. She no longer existed in the physical. She existed in the Non-physical. Dioro Dies. The probability of Survival of everything to 0.5 by sacrificing herself. The explosion is the containment of the structured plasma.
