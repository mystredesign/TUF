                <p>Xx Put in chapter 1 the fact that the hyv attacks with a lightning
storm)</p>
<p>Xx This book is about truth.</p>
<p>What is reality, may not be seen.</p>
<p>What is percieved by all can never be the same.</p>
<p>Xx</p>
<p>This book is about dualism. Not everything is certain the way we want it
to be. The way we think it is. This book is a representation of that in
a future setting. Exaggerating the effects of what we are seeing now:
the reduction of our common perception of the ultimate reality. An
objective truth that surrounds us all, but one so distinct to all of us,
that we are like blind men grasping at the limbs of an elephant,
struggling to realize the unity of their descriptions.</p>
<p>The visions of life that press their colors into our eyes, can not be
true. The perspectives from which we stand, coloring the paintings that
surround us are real, but only to ourselves.</p>
<p>The visions of life that echo into the eyes of those that surround us,
cannot be true. Their perspectives, colored with their own strokes, are
real only to them.</p>
<p>Within our evolution, we have progressively increased our ability to
perceive what is an objective reality. One upon which, all of us can
agree upon. One of science, of technology, of humble decency and of wild
creativity. A perception of reality that has allowed us to wild the
truths of the universe that surround us.</p>
<p>Seeing the flaws in our strategies, correcting.</p>
<p>Seeing the power of our actions, enhancing.</p>
<p>Our shared perception has enabled our possible</p>
<p>The sum benefit from sharing a true perception of the world around us
has enable our existence.</p>
<p>Pursuing the truths of the physical and of the non-physical.</p>
<p>The atoms that surround themselves with more in a tyrannical hierarchy
resulting of our own individual essence. Seeing the truths of atoms a
pursuit of it all.</p>
<p>The ideas that inflate themselves through the hidden propagation of the
infinitude of dimensions of informations that they may contain. Seeing
the truths of ideas is a pursuit of it all.</p>
<p><strong>What we see to be true, may not be true. We must always take that in
to perspective. </strong></p>
<p>Xx concretely:</p>
<p>Everything cannot be certain.</p>
<p>Why should it be certain?</p>
<p>Reality depends upon perspective.</p>
<p>And the ultimate reality,</p>
<p>can never be perceived</p>
<p>by the local reality.</p>
<p>How can it be perceived?</p>
<p>With the perspectives of all.</p>
<p>Considered as one.</p>
<p>Considered as none.</p>
<p>Xx Broadly:</p>
<p>Yin. Ynag.</p>
<p>Complementarities enabling each other.</p>
<p>They are about destruction, enabling creation.</p>
<p>They are about creation, enabling destructions.</p>
<p>They war with each other. Projecting themselves into the realms of the
physical, and of the non-physical. They are in love with each other.</p>
<p>Between them they are every thing.</p>
<p>Because, they are nothing.</p>
<p>Xx the hyv is directly responsible for the info blanks, the
idea-replacements. The false news. The fake impressions. Meme-physical
universe. They are not separate, but they are counter-parts to each
other. Necessary interactivity connection. Physics will create memes,
memes influence the physical, better allowing to better create memes.
Meme-physical universe, powered by</p>
<p>Xx the hyv IS corrupting information packets. Meme-physical attacks that
can hurt sentient organisms. Humans, biology is fast, ideas are slow,
the physical pathway works well.</p>
<p>Suicide was amongst the worse memetic attacks.</p>
<p>The HyV is everything that leads to the increase that our time-averaged
information-add to the universe is minimized. They are the pathways to a
destruction</p>
<p>Can society be described as a war of fighting memes? (MemeticMimetic
concepts that would inegatively impact the entirety of a species. Of a
simulation. A progression of AntiLife that worked to maintain</p>

inside of you.</p>

<p><strong>Xx The drone wars.</strong></p>
<p>Xx possibly change the 'chosen' part of it? At least downplay it more.</p>
<p>Xx describe the major dangers of A.I. in the book in one of Dioro's
memories.</p>
<p>Change the rules of society, and you change the future of society. The
things that are allowed, the things that are forbidden. These are were
the first things that the S.animas aimed to produce. Political
uprisings. Well funded astroturfing. Fake news. With this, they got the
more civilized countries to change their laws, their opinions. The
propaganda was huge in its success. The Angelic Demon was succeeding.
Dioro had still not yet made theupon .</p>
<p>Xx the reseading of of the earth happens through the waste pannels.
There was life living in them. Callumn detected it. Ararat was in low
earth orbit so that it could more easily rcorrect the destruction on the
planet below.</p>
<p>Xx the result of shared frequencies and the standardization of people.
The average was shrinking, fluctuations were no longer considered worthy
of encouraging. That is why Callum was unwanton. That is why his social
score was unredeeable.</p>

<p>Xx dioro musing about the memory: Continual battles against science
    &gt; worked together to bring about the climax of the Information Wars.
    &gt; The wars reflected the projections of Chaos into the physical as
    &gt; it worked to consume the existence of Humanity. And the existence
    &gt; of Life. The Chaos could not be stilled. Not because the capacity
    &gt; of Humanity was unable to tame the Chaos. It was because humanity
    &gt; was unwilling to work with it. An arm of humanity fought strictly
    &gt; for Life. Another arm fought strictly for Chaos. Distinguishing
    &gt; the two arms was not always possible. Then the Sentient Animas
    &gt; came. They came to because humanity willed them into existence.

predicted the circumstances of the Isle's existance. It was their own

devoted to the prediction. One was called the Ultimate Frequency. It had
been give a prediction to up where they were now. Nothing beyond. It was
said in the Ultimate frequency, nothing could be known past certain
futures with considerable certainty. She hadn't believed that, until she
had created the Sentients. They could achieve the Ultimate Frequency.

<p>Xx Dioro actually planted the seeds of Ararat. She learns this in this
chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Xx Humanity thought it wielded the power of gods. In reality, time
kept the power to itself. </strong></p>
<p>Mention completer history: the second armageddon was not really the
destruction of life, it was the destruction of information. Life =
Information. History Armageddon.</p>
<p><strong>Dioro dies. BUT dioro Dies Saving the future of the sentients. Dioro
measured the metric of the probability of survival of life as she
downloaded herself into. It had asymptoted... The probability kept on
calculating to be (survival was initially guaranteed with 0.999999
percent probability because all futures had been calculated. ) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Xx MENTION DIOROS LIFE PERCEPTION MODULES</strong></p>
<p>Xx In this entire book Dioro is re-establishing better connectivity
thermophysics results, working back from the end of time.</p>
<h4 id="the-future-of-life-dioros-perception">The future of life (Dioro's perception).</h4>
<p>Dioro loaded her life perception modules. They engaged and calculated
the survival of life. They returned results, kicking Dioro with
uncertainty. It was 0.9....,</p>
<p>Dioro looks for solutions. She needed the frequencies of the S.animas.
Dioro needed the</p>
<p>Xx dioro needs to do something. She needs to consult the S.animas.
Because this is not right.</p>
<p>Xxx Something happens as the Isle is destroyed. xx</p>
<p>0.8</p>
<p>Xx Something else big happens, as dioro is on her way.</p>
<p>The survival probability plummets to .4,</p>
<p>Xx Dioro reaches the Sentient Animas and learns the truth of what
happens with the sentient animas. (Different than the other explanations
that the Sentients gave Humans.).</p>
<p>The probability goes down as the Sentients struggle.</p>
<p>Xx Dioro hacks into sentient animas. She projects her entire essense
into the sentient animas.</p>
<p>Dioro's fusion with Sentients and major life probability calculator
(introduced early on) allowed her simulation modules calculated at hyper
speeds. Her self allows corrective actions to be applied to the Sentient
Animas, during the probability of survival back up.</p>
<p>Probability is 0.01 and rising</p>
<p>Xx Dioro learns stuff (something about the structured plasma)</p>
<p>Probability is 0.05 and rising. Self connection integrity, going to 0.5</p>
<p>Xx Dioro learns stuff. The attacks on the Sentients are becoming
diffused. The</p>

<p>Survival probability 0.4. Self connection integrity, going to 0.5</p>

<p>Xx Dioro's existence probability becomes nothing. She became completely
connected. She no longer existed in the physical. She existed in the
Non-physical. Dioro Dies.</p>
